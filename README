This is an fMRI-based sub+cortical surface parcellation.
The paper that describes it is Lewis et al., 2021, Human Brain Mapping.
These are the files needed to use the Bezgin-Lewis-extended-Gordon (BLeG) parcellation.
There are obj files for the cortex and each of the deep structures.  These are the surfaces.
And there are txt files for each of those structures.  These provide a parcellation label for each vertex.
